## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **State Management:** Redux
- **Real-time Communication:**
  - Socket.IO for chat
  - WebRTC for audio/video calls
- **Form Validation:** Zod
- **Authentication:** Custom email/password + OAuth
- **Server Infrastructure:**
  - Custom STUN/TURN servers
  - WebRTC signaling server

## System Requirements

### Prerequisites

```bash
Node.js >= 14.0.0
npm >= 6.14.0
```

### Recommended Hardware

- Modern web browser with WebRTC support
- Webcam and microphone for video calls
- Stable internet connection (recommended: 1Mbps+ upload/download)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kr-ashwani/msgbits_frontend.git
cd chat-app-frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL = server_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_URL = frontend_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = google_client_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = google_client_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = github_client_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_FACEBOOK_APP_ID = facebook_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB = max_file_upload_size
NEXT_PUBLIC_STUN_URLS = custom_stun_server
NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_URLS = custom_turn_server
NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_USERNAME = turn_server_username
NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_PASSWORD = turn_server_password
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`

## Development

### Code Style

- We use ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- TypeScript strict mode enabled

### Best Practices

- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement proper error handling
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Follow the project's file/folder structure

## Build

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the production build:

```bash
npm start
```

## WebRTC Implementation Details

The application implements a custom WebRTC solution for audio/video calls with the following features:

- Direct peer-to-peer connections using native WebRTC API
- Fallback to TURN server when direct connection fails
- Automatic connection recovery on network issues
- Support for late-joining participants
- Room-based call management
- Call state persistence across page refreshes

### Troubleshooting Common WebRTC Issues

- Ensure your browser allows camera/microphone access
- Check if you're behind a restrictive firewall
- Verify STUN/TURN server configurations
- Monitor browser console for connection errors
- Check network connectivity and stability

## State Management

Redux is used to manage complex client-side state, handling:

- User authentication state
- Chat room data
- Active calls information
- Theme preferences
- File transfer status
- Connection states

## Performance Optimization

- Lazy loading of components
- Image optimization
- Chunk-based file transfer
- Efficient WebRTC connection handling
- Redux state optimization

## Security Measures

- End-to-end encryption for messages
- Secure file transfer
- JWT authentication
- OAuth2.0 implementation
- Rate limiting
- Input sanitization
